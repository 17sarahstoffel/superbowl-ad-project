Looking for trends in Superbowl ads in the last 20 years
 
## Project Proposal
For this project, we will work with a dataset that covers Super Bowl ads from 2000 to 2020. This dataset holds a description of ads from the 10 brands that had the most advertisements in Super Bowls in those 20 years. The dataset also contains a direct YouTube URL for each ad, and the descriptors are funny, shows the product quickly, patriotic, celebrity (involves a celebrity), danger (contains danger), animal (involves animals), and uses sex (if sexual in nature).
        	We plan to study patterns in those ads and determine what kinds of ads have been used most often in the past 20 years, and which ones get rewatched the most on YouTube. In addition, we will investigate how the trend of ad length has changed in the last 20 years.

        	Our tasks include the following:
Importing and cleaning of ad data.
Use of YouTube API to get likes, dislikes, length, and views for each YouTube link.
Addition of columns to the ad data frame with YouTube data.
An exploratory analysis of the targeted research questions.
Calculate summary statistics on the counts of the ad tags.
Perform our hypothesis test.
* see below
Perform our linear regression.
* see below

For visual representation, we have for now decided to create a final summary using a scatter plot with a regression line (ad length vs ad year), a bar chart (YouTube views separated by type), and a pie chart to show the types of ads.

*Hypothesis: Funny ads get rewatched on YouTube the most.
*Regression: Ad length over the years.
